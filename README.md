# xRAC
xRAC implements execution and network access control for restricted application containers (RACs) using 802.1X. The research paper ([preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03544)) was accepted for the main technical track of [NOMS 2020](https://noms2020.ieee-noms.org/). In addition, we submitted a demo paper that is currently in review.

In this repository, you can find [testbed setup](testbed-setup.md), [experiment instructions](experiments.md) and the source code of all software parts.
